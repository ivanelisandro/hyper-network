# Docker Project: Hyper Network

This is one of the projects provided by JetBrains Academy, a platform for studying programming languages.

The project used Docker commands to create networks and volumes to establish communication and data exchange between containers.

## Objectives

The objective of the project was to learn how to:

- Create and shared volumes;
- Create shared networks;
- Create a postgreSQL database container;
- Create a container with a database administration tool using `adminer`;
- The project suggested simply running the Docker commands in a terminal, but I chose to deploy the containers using a `docker-compose.yml` file instead;

## Structure

The main files of interest are available at:

- `.\HyperNetwork\task\docker-compose.yml`
 
In the `.\HyperNetwork\task\` directory there are also Markdown files describing what was intended during each stage of the course.

Files on other directories were automatically created by the course.
