# Stage 4:

In this stage, we will use `adminer` to create records.

## Objectives

Required configuration:

- Open the tool running locally at `http://localhost:8080`;
- Connect to the `hyper-db` database with `adminer`;
- Create the `users` table;
- In the `users` table, create the `id` field of the `integer` type;
- In the `users` table, create the `user_name` field of the `varchar` type, length `99`;
- Insert one record with the `99` id and the `hyper-user` username.
